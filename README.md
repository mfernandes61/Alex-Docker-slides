                --{{1}}--
Managing your data effectively is crucial to the success of your research. This doesn't only apply to the immediate context of your thesis or publications. Managing your data is a practice that will benefit you throughout your research career. The following list gives an overview of what benefits are evident.

                  {{1}}
1. **Access, Re-use & Recognition**
   * Facilitating future research by allowing others to build on or add to your research data.
   * Increased citations of research data and of publications based on that data.
2. **Efficiency**
   * Increasing your research efficiency by saving time and resources.
   * Preventing duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data.
3. **Quality & Security**
   * Ensuring the integrity and reproducibility of your research.
   * Ensuring that research data and records are accurate, complete, authentic and reliable.
   * Enhancing data security and minimising the risk of data loss.
4. **Compliance**
   * Meeting legal obligations, restrictions and codes of conduct.
   * Meeting the University policy for research data requirements.
   * Meeting funding body grant requirements.
   * Meeting publisher requirements for data access.


### A case to consider

        {{0-1}}
Marleen is an early career researcher. She completed her PhD about four years ago and is now a postdoctoral research fellow at a different university. Since she obtained her PhD, she has published a number of journal articles based on her doctoral research. Her papers have been cited widely in the literature of her field. But just recently a fellow researcher has questioned her findings. He has gone so far as to suggest that the data on which her research was based is inaccurate. One implication is that the data could even have been falsified. Marleen is confident that her research is valid and that her data is accurate.


    --{{1}}--

    - What steps could Marleen take to verify her research findings?
    - What evidence would she need to demonstrate that she hasn't falsified her data?

       {{1}}
Think about your own research. If someone accused you of research misconduct, would you be in a position to defend your research and reputation? List some strategies you could implement right now that would assist you, should you ever find yourself in Marleen’s situation.

### Data disasters – postcards from the edge

The following are real examples where researchers or data centers have lost crucial data. Could any of these ever happen to you? With good planning you could avoid or reduce the impact of such occurrences.

### University policy framework for research data

For the Flemish universities, it is important that all researchers honour scientific standards, including the meticulous and ethical treatment of research data.
This policy is intended to set out parameters to safeguard the quality, availability and accessibility of research data within any Flemish university. It provides a basis for evaluating compliance with laws, regulations and codes of conduct. The policy also clarifies the various roles and responsibilities of university staff in managing research data.

The highlights of the policy are:
* Archive (relevant and valuable) research data for a minimum of ten years;
* Store data in a structure that is suitable for long-term preservation and later consultation;
* Provide metadata to describe the data with sufficient clarity to ensure they are findable for further research;
* Make archived research data available for access and reuse at and outside VIB insofar as is reasonably possible;
* Each individual researcher / research leader is responsible to draw up a Data Management Plan (DMP) at the start of the research project and to follow up the agreements made in this plan;
* Scientific directors are responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the University policy framework and for drawing up additional faculty guidelines to this end if needed.

### Policy in Practise

In this short video Prof. dr. Chantal Kemner explains the importance of good data management for Utrecht University. Chantal is full professor of Biological Developmental Psychology in Utrecht at the faculty of social sciences and since 2013 also at the UMCU.

### Funder requirements

More and more research funders explicitly require you to consider the management and publication of your research data, both during and after your research project. The European Commission and the Flemish funders FWO have explicit policies on research data management.

**European Commission - Horizon 2020**

The European Commission wants “Horizon 2020 beneficiaries to make their research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), to ensure it is soundly managed. Good research data management is not a goal in itself, but rather the key conduit leading to knowledge discovery and innovation, and to subsequent data and knowledge integration and reuse.” Horizon 2020 is the biggest research and innovation program of the European Commission.

[![European Commission - Horizon 2020](img/O_Funders_Screenshot_H2020guidelines.JPG "European Commission - Horizon 2020")](https://www.nwo.nl/en/policies/open+science/data+management)

**FWO**

FWO states that “FWO has made data management a key element of its policy for all support channels provided by the FWO. The FWO expects researchers to pay due attention to this dimension before, during and for at least five years after their research.”

[FWO Overview Data Management Plan](https://www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/organisation/data-management-plan/)

### Funder guidelines and templates

Most funders require you to write a Data Management Plan. A DMP outlines all key aspects of collecting, storing and managing research data during and after a project. For this they provide you with guidelines, forms, templates and examples. For more information you can download the documents under Resources or check out the websites. You can also contact your faculty Research Support Office:

- [EC – Horizon 2020: guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm)
- [FWO template]()

### Writing a data management plan

By now it should be clear that data needs to be properly managed throughout its lifecycle. The most effective way to do this is to create a Data Management Plan (DMP). This will take into account all the stages of the research data lifecycle. As outlined earlier, each individual researcher or research leader is responsible to draw up a data management plan. He or she should do this at the start of the research project. And during the research you should actively follow up on the agreements made in this plan.

Think about our early career researcher Sasha (introduced in ‘Why manage your research materials and data?’) who needs to defend herself against accusations of researcher misconduct. As well as defending against misconduct accusations, some additional benefits of creating a data management plan include:

- Accessing your data more easily;
- Prioritising and balancing activities relating to research data collection and storage;
- Mitigating data loss;
- Reaching agreement between stakeholders about ownership of data;
- Reducing time and effort in the long term.
The good news is that this online training will take you through the necessary steps to create a plan during the subsequent modules.

### Getting started with DMPonline

We offer you DMPonline to create your Data Management Plan. DMPonline is an international online service that guides you in creating a DMP by answering a series of questions about your research project. It allows you to create, share, store, and revise your data management plans online. You will be asked to complete different sections of your DMP as we go through the other modules. As a result you will have written your own data management plan at the end of this course.

With DMPonline you can:

* Write your plan and keep it up-to-date
  * You can easily update your DMP throughout the lifecycle of a project

* Share plans online
  * DMPonline allows collaborative access, so you can share your DMP with other researchers, within and outside of Utrecht University.

* Create multiple plans
  * You can store different DMPs for different projects. And you can make a copy of a previous plan as the basis for writing a new one.

* Download plans
  * You can download your DMP in a variety of formats.

We recommend that graduate researchers share their data management plans with their supervisor(s).

## Prepare: Data Collection

### Introduction to data collection

By now you will have obtained some idea of what research data management is all about. Now we will have a more in-depth look into the different phases of your research by starting with data collection.

Data collection involves understanding the different types of data you collect. Depending on the nature of your research, there are different methods of collecting data and thus different types of data.

Your data may be physical (paper records or archival forms) or digital (database contents or Excel data). The source of your data may be external, you collect it yourself or you generate it from a machine.

When you write your data management plan you will need to take into account the type of data you collect, the source of the data, and how you will process and analyse your data.

**In this part of the course you will learn to:**

* identify preferred file formats for your research data;
transform your files into a preferred format;
discover sources for existing data;

* discover existing data yourself;

* how to assess the usefulness of existing data;
understand how a workflow leads to data products;

* estimate costs involved with managing your data;

* check the current and expected costs for your research data;

* write the data collection section for your data management plan.

You can watch the video below, provided by TU Delft, about data collection. The video stops at 1:12.

*****************************

              --{{2}}--
The file formats you use to generate your research data will influence how you can manage them over time, i.e. a program or application must be able to recognise the file format in order to access your data within the file.
For example, a web browser is able to process and display a file in the HTML file format so that it appears as a web page. If the browser encounters another file type, it may need to call on a special plug-in to view it. Or it may simply let you download the file to view if it can recognise it in another program.

                 {{2-3}}
******************************

To identify the file format, files usually have a file name extension, or suffix that follows a full stop in the file name and contains three or four letters, like for example:

TODO: add PDF with links to preferred file formats
* .txt    text
* .pdf    portable document format
* .jpg    joint photographic experts group
* .csv    comma separated values
* .html   hypertext markup language
* .xml  extensible markup language  
* .rtf  rich text format

### Discovering existing data

TODO: block

### Describe what kind of data you will generate

Having a clear view of what data you will generate will enable you to plan its management. You can create an overview of the data you produce or collect by drawing the data in a workflow, or noting down in a table.

Please watch the video below. Tessa Pronk will explain to you how to describe your data.

!?[Describing your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE2UpZY4wYA&feature=youtu.be)

### Order elements in your data flow

TODO: add H5P quiz

### Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues

Copyright is a form of intellectual property right which arises automatically if an original work is created. Copyright may affect the way data may be stored, shared and reused. You should ask yourself who the copyright holder of your datasets is, especially when you use existing data or when you collaborate with external parties.

**Using someone else’s research data**
SURF provides a brief guide to determining what consent is necessary to reuse someone else’s data (see "A brief guide ... someone else's data" in the resources below)  

**Clarifying the ownership of your research data**
TODO: change accordingly for VIB
Officially VIB, as your employer, is considered the rights holder to the research data you create. You, as a researcher, have the primary responsibility for taking care of the data. Questions on data exploitation may be even more important than those of ownership. Who can use the data? Who can publish it? Who can provide it to third parties?  

We strongly recommend that you deal with the issues around data exploitation at an early stage of your research project. Write down agreements between yourself, your supervisor, project members and other interested parties in your Data Management Plan.

TODO: change accordingly
RDM Support offers you a Guide to legal instruments and agreements for research data management (see the Guide 'Legal instruments and agreements')

**Confidential or privacy-sensitive data**
When your research project has received data under confidentiality or under legal privacy restrictions, you will have to identify and explain how you will deal with these restrictions in your data management plan (also see ‘Learning Unit: Handle - Data security’).

### Costs involved with managing your data

Check
https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/costs-of-data-management

        --{{1}}--
The costs of data management and sharing activities must be included into your research, in terms of time and resources needed.

         {{1}}
*****************************

**1. Data Management Cost Guide**

When you plan your research you may not be able to oversee all costs involved. Nevertheless, it is useful to have an idea of possible costs at an early stage. You can use the Guide 'Costs of Data Management', which is a practical overview of possible costs per activity within each phase of the research process. Note: The Cost Guide offers cost indications and examples. These are not real prices.

**2. Budget your data management costs**

You are advised to budget the data management costs as separate data management costs. These costs are eligible for funding with funders like NWO and the European Commission, as long as the costs are invoiced before the end of the project.

**3. Planning can save time and money**

Planning an early start for certain activities within your research project can lower the costs for data management in the run of your project. You can save time by:

Properly describing your data while collecting it, instead of doing it afterwards
Choosing the right file format so that file conversion afterwards is not necessary
Hiring an experienced data manager
Spending time to think about data activities beforehand can help prevent unexpected extra efforts and costs later on in your research project.

*****************************

### Check the current and expected costs for your research data

You have just learned that in many parts of a research project there are data related costs. These costs depend on the type and volume of data you produce, analyse and store.

### Write your data management plan for your data collection

Go to DMPonline and open your draft data management plan created in the Introduction.

You have now completed the module Data collection. You should be able to complete the following questions in the section Data collection:

* Will you use existing data?
* What data will you collect or create?
* How will the data be collected or created?
* How will you manage rights issues?
* What are the costs involved in managing and storing your data?
